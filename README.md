### 🎥 Genre Performance
- **Adventure, Action, and Sci-Fi** generate the highest total revenues.

- **Documentary, News, Sport, and War** consistently underperform financially.

### 💰 Profitability & ROI
- **Horror films** deliver the highest ROI:

  - Lower financial risk
- High-budget films generate high revenue but show large variability and lower efficiency.

### 🌍 Domestic vs Foreign Markets
- Strong positive correlation between domestic and foreign revenue.
- High-performing films tend to succeed globally, not just domestically.
- Foreign markets often contribute more than 50% of total revenue.

### ⭐ Ratings & Popularity
- Audience popularity (number of votes) correlates more strongly with revenue than ratings.
- High ratings alone do not guarantee financial success.

### 📆 Industry Trends
- Film production peaked around 2015–2016.
- Total box office revenue increased steadily until 2018, followed by a decline likely influenced by market saturation and streaming growth.
